## 📄 Contract Routes

- `pending`: Pending approval from landlord
- `active`: Active contract (both parties signed)
- `expiring_soon`: Contract expiring soon
- `expired`: Contract expired
- `terminated`: Contract terminated
- `rented`: Rented (legacy compatibility)
- `rejected`: Contract rejected

**Contract Features:**
- Property and Unit linking
- Start and end dates
- Rent amount and deposit amount
- Payment cycle (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Electronic signatures (landlord and tenant)
- Termination requests
- Contract renewal
- PDF document generation
- Contract attachments

### `/api/ai/recommend` - Smart System
- Input:
  - `question: string`
  - `filters?: { budget?, city?, rooms?, type?, operation? }`
- Behavior:
  - Queries `Property`, `Contract`, `Payment`, `MaintenanceRequest`, `Complaint` collections.
  - Builds a compact context describing:
    - Available properties.
    - User contracts and payments.
    - User maintenance and complaints.
  - Sends all of this as **structured text** to OpenAI and gets an Arabic answer.

### `/api/ai/assistant` - Unified Intent Engine
- Input:
  - `question: string` (Arabic natural language)
- Internal flow:
  1. **Intent detection** from free text:
     - `search_properties_on_map`
     - `search_properties`
     - `contracts_expiring_soon`
     - `late_payments`
     - `general`
  2. For property intents:
     - Queries `Property` with filters extracted from the question (city, budget, rooms, operation).
     - Builds `properties` list + `map` object with `center` and `markers` from GeoJSON `location.coordinates`.
  3. For contracts expiring:
     - Queries `Contract` where `endDate` is within the next 30 days for the current user.
  4. For late payments:
     - Queries `Payment` + `Contract` for unpaid payments where `date < now` for current user.
  5. For general questions:
     - Builds a **database snapshot** (counts + user-specific stats).
     - Loads `ai_knowledge/` files and passes both snapshot + docs to OpenAI.

#### Typical Responses
- Property/map intent:
  - `answer`: Arabic explanation.
  - `properties`: Array of property documents.
  - `map`: `{ center: { lat, lng }, markers: [...] }`.
- Contracts/payments intent:
  - `contracts` or `payments` arrays.
- General intent:
  - `answer`: Arabic explanation mixing docs + DB snapshot when relevant.
